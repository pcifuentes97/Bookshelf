            "description":"Chimney Swifts, birds that nest and roost in chimneys, have been historically abundant in North America. But by the late 1980s, the number of swifts migrating to North America from the Amazon River Basin had declined. A growing number of people across North America are now constructing nesting towers and conducting Chimney Swift conservation projects in their own communities. With Chimney Swift Towers, concerned bird conservationists have a step-by-step guide to help them create more habitat for these beneficial, insect-eating birds. Chimney Swift experts Paul and Georgean Kyle give directions for building freestanding wooden towers, wooden kiosk towers, masonry towers, and other structures. Included are - design basics, - lists of materials needed, - useful diagrams and photographs, - and detailed instructions on site preparation, tower construction, installation, and maintenance. Anyone with basic woodworking or masonry skills and an interest in wildlife conservation will find this publication helpful. That includes do-it-yourselfers, homeowners involved in creating backyard habitat for wildlife, landscape and structural architects, park and wildscape managers, wildlife management area professionals, nature centers, garden centers, scout troops, and other civic organizations in search of community service projects.",

With this practical guide, skilled programmers with little or no knowledge of Apple development will learn how to code with the latest version of Swift by developing a working iOS app from start to finish. You’ll begin with Swift programming basics—including guidelines for making your code \"Swifty\"—and learn how to work with Xcode and its built-in Interface Builder. Then you’ll dive step-by-step into building and customizing a basic app for taking, editing, and deleting selfies. You’ll also tune and test the app for performance and manage the app’s presence in the App Store. Divided into four parts, this book includes: Swift 4 basics: Learn Swift’s basic building blocks and the features of object-oriented development Building the Selfiegram app: Build model objects and the UI for your selfie app and add location support, user settings, and notifications Polishing Selfiegram: Create a theme and support for sharing and add custom views, image overlays, and localization Beyond app development: Debug and performance test with Xcode, automate chores with Fastlane, and user-test the app with TestFlight",

You'll learn about unit testing, mocking and continuous integration and how to get these key ingredients running in your Swift projects. This book also looks at how to write your Swift apps using test driven development (TDD). Agile practices have made major inroads in iOS development, however it’s very unusual to see something as basic as unit testing on a Swift application. Done correctly, Agile development results in a significant increase in development efficiency and a reduction in the number of defects. Apple has released unit testing and code coverage frameworks for Swift development in XCode. Up until now getting unit testing up and running in Swift was not for the faint-hearted. Thankfully now, there is no excuse other than a lack of information on where to get started. iOS developers are faced with their own set of problems such as tightly coupled code, fragmentation, immature testing tools all of which can be solved using existing Agile tools and techniques. Swift Programming Using Agile Tools and Techniques is your solution to handling these tasks. What You Will Learn Write unit tests in Swift Write an application using test driven development Examine GUI testing, refactoring, and mocking frameworks Set up and configure a continuous integration server Measure code coverage Who This Book Is For Swift developers and would be mobile app testers will benefit from the guidance in this book.",

So many Indians moved along the path that George, who rode near the front of the line, could not see the end when he turned around to look. The farther they went, the more unhappy George became. For with every step, Neko (his faithful pony) took him farther and farther from his home and from Ma and Pa. Even the fluttering leaves seemed like little hands waving good-bye all the day long. So begins chapter seven of this beloved classic by Josephine Cunnington Edwards. George, a young pioneer boy is captured by Indians and raised as the son of a mighty chief. He spends his time learning the ways of these native Americans, and yearning for the day that he might find a way to return to his loving family.",
